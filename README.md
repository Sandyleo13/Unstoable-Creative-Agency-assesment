🎯 Why This Project Stands Out

🟥 Bold custom UI — not boilerplate, but uniquely designed
🧊 Glassmorphism done right — balanced blur, shadow, depth
⚡ Fast + clean code — ideal for assessments
🧠 UX focused — intuitive interactions, clear visuals
🎨 Creative styling — makes the project memorable
📱 Perfect responsiveness — mobile-first friendly

This project fully meets and exceeds the assessment requirements with polish and creativity.
